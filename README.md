# Welcome to the OCEAN Lab Docs Github repository!

This repository contains everything used by [Read The Docs](https://about.readthedocs.com/?ref=readthedocs.org) to build our documentation site, which can be found at [https://oceanlabdocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://oceanlabdocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

### Want to contribute?

These docs are built using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/), a framework that uses the ReStructured Text (RST) markup format to generate sophisticated documentation webpages automatically. Information on working with Sphinx/RST can be found [here](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/index.html).
