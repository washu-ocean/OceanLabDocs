How to SSH into Wallace
-----------------------

On Mac
^^^^^^

1. Open up the Terminal application; you can find this by typing <command+space> and searching for Terminal, which should have an icon with ``>_`` in the upper-right corner.
    - Unless you're using WashU wifi (wusm-secure), you'll need to be VPN'ed into WashU's network.
2. To SSH into Wallace for the first time, enter the following command::

    ssh <your-NIL-username>@wallace.neuroimage.wustl.edu -Y

3. You should then be prompted to enter your password. Type it in then press ``<Enter>``.

.. warning::

   There are no characters that will appear as you type in your password, so keep that in mind! If you think you made a typo, simply holding the <Backspace> key until you think all the characters are erased works.
